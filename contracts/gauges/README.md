# LIX Fork Notes
- deleted a bunch of shit from here because it's annoying to keep track of
- Kept LiquidityGaugeV3.vy in case anyone want to do a code diff with LiquidityGaugeLix.vy

* [`LiquidityGauge`](LiquidityGauge.vy): Measures the amount of liquidity provided by each user.
* [`LiquidityGaugeReward`](LiquidityGaugeReward.vy): Measures provided liquidity and stakes using the [Synthetix rewards contract](https://github.com/curvefi/unipool-fork).
