For gauges, swap out lp_token (currently the CurveTokenV3.vy) for LixirVault compatability
  actually they only use ERC20 functions so this is done

Rip out rewards distribution accordingg to inflation supply, add in another contract that
acts as a hodler of LIX that can then be distributed at some rate.

Need a new way of handling epochs. This is baked into CRV20, and we don't have that...


BIG DIFFS TO GAUGES
- ripped out all synthetix rewards. idk wtf they are.
- swapped inflation rate for distribution rate. Need a scheme for dealing with this and updating it
- instead of a Minter() we need a Distributor() contract (yet to be written or figured out)
  - needs to implement the functionality of CRV20 inflation schedule and Minter functions

BIG DIFFS TO GAUGE CONTROLLER
- might remove vote_for_gauge_weights because we just want to set them right?

TALK ABOUT FEE COLLECTION
- read this https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html
- it's really complicated. Lots of swaps to get it into the correct token (3CRV for them, will be LIX for us)
- Fees are claimed by and burned by the PoolProxy.vy contract, then converted to USDC (3CRV)
  - must write a VaultProxy.vy contract
- Need a bunch of burn contracts that go from X token to LIX (or USDC? Whatever token)
- Might need to alter FeeDistributor contract (we'll see)
